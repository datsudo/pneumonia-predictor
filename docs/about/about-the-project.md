# About this project

The core of this program&mdash;the `Rf-ActiveSMOTE` model&mdash;is a proposal model from our thesis titled "Pneumonia Admission Predictor Using Random Forest Integrated with Active SMOTE".

`RF-ActiveSMOTE` is a combination of **Active SMOTE** (**S**ynthetic **M**inority **O**versampling **TE**chnique), together with **Random Forest** (RF) classification algorithm. The Active SMOTE was initially proposed by Sena & Ben Hamida in their paper: [Active SMOTE for Imbalanced Medical Data Classification](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-51664-1_6), that was published in January 2024. RF was combined with this to mitigate some of the SMOTE's issues. Primarily on how it selects the samples needed to generate synthetic data.
