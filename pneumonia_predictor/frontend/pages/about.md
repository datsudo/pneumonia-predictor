## About this project

This app helps predict the likelihood of hospital admission for patients with
pneumonia based on the provided [features](#features). By analyzing key medical
indicators and patient data, it provides healthcare professionals with insights
to make more informed decisions, optimizing patient care and resource
allocation.

> *This application is designed for patients or healthcare professionals who
> have knowledge of the patient's existing comorbidities. If you are unsure
> about any of these factors, please seek guidance from a medical professional.*
>
> *For any confusions, this application does not predict the occurrence of
> pneumonia but rather assesses the likelihood of a patient being admitted due
> to pneumonia.*

For predictor, we provided two machine learning models:

- `RfActiveSMOTE`, and
- `RfSMOTE`

To use the app, go to `Predict` section.

To use them with your own datasets, see the
        [documentation](https://datsudo.github.io/pneumonia-predictor/getting-started/model-usage/).

To set this web app locally, see `Local Setup` tab section.

### Features
The selected features that the model uses for prediction are based on the
meta-analysis conducted by Fang et al. in their paper "Risk factors for hospital
readmissions in pneumonia patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis"
(2022).[^1] From the 17 studies that they reviewed, here are resulting features:

- **age**: age of the patient, restricted to individuals above 18 years old;
  three studies reported that pneumonia patients aged 65+ years has odds ratio
  (OR) of 0.90, which indicates that the said group have 0.90 times the risk of
  being readmitted compared to other age bracket
- **sex**: biological sex of the patient, classified as male or female; thirteen
  studies shows that males have 1.19 times higher odds of having readmission
  compared to female.
- **chronic respiratory disease**: presence of any chronic respiratory
  condition, including but not limited to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease (COPD), or other long-term respiratory disorders; ten studies show
  that patients with chronic respiratory disease have significantly higher odds
  (with 1.37 OR) of having readmission than those who do not have it
- **diabetes mellitus**: presence of any type of diabetes mellitus, including
  Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes; seven studies reported that diabetes patients have
  1.18 times higher odds of having hospital readmissions compared to
  non-diabetes patients
- **heart failure**: presence of any form of heart failure, whether acute or
  chronic; nine studies reported that patients with heart failure have 1.28
  times higher odds of having readmissions compared to patients without heart
  failure
- **cancer**: presence of any type of cancer, whether in remission or active;
  patients with cancer have higher odds, with 1.94 OR, of having readmissions
  compared to patients without cancer
- **chronic kidney disease**: presence of any form of chronic kidney disease,
  including stages 1 to 5 or those undergoing dialysis; five studies show that
  patients with chronic kidney disease have 1.38 times higher odds of having
  hospital readmissions compared to patients without the said disease

Addition to these are the vital signs based on the clinical guidelines, and
symptoms of pneumonia by Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare
(2021)[^2]:

- respiratory rate,
- pulse rate,
- systolic blood pressure,
- diastolic blood pressure,
- temperature,
- fatigue,
- cough with phlegm, and
- complete blood count (CBC) which composes of white and red blood cells (WBC,
  RBC) hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HT), and platelet count

### Feature importance

Below are the feature importance graphs generated by our pre-trained models that
shows how much each feature impacts their decision. Both model shows that *age*
plays a significant role in their predictions. The rest of the features have
mostly the same level of significance.

For calculating the importance, we used **mean decrease in impurity** (MDI) or
**Gini importance**. MDI measures how often a feature is used in the decision
tree and how many samples are affected by those splits.[^3] The more a feature
is used to split large groups of data, the more important it’s considered.
