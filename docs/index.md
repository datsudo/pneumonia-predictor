This app helps predict the likelihood of hospital admission for patients with pneumonia. By analyzing key medical indicators and patient data, it provides healthcare professionals with insights to make more informed decisions, optimizing patient care and resource allocation.

For predictor, we provided two machine learning models:

- `RfActiveSMOTE`, and
- `RfSMOTE`

To use them with your own datasets, see [usage](./getting-started/usage.md) page.

The application is currently hosted at Hugging Face:
<https://huggingface.co/spaces/datsudo/pneumonia-predictor>.

To set it up locally, follow the [setup](./getting-started/setup.md) instructions.
