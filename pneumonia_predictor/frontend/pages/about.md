## About this project

This app helps predict the likelihood of hospital admission for patients with pneumonia. By analyzing key medical indicators and patient data, it provides healthcare professionals with insights to make more informed decisions, optimizing patient care and resource allocation.

For predictor, we provided two machine learning models:

- `RfActiveSMOTE`, and
- `RfSMOTE`

To use the app, go to `Predict` section.

To use them with your own datasets, see the
        [documentation](https://datsudo.github.io/pneumonia-predictor/getting-started/model-usage/).

To set this web app locally, see `Local Setup` tab section.
